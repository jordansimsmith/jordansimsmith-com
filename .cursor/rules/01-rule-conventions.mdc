# Cursor rule conventions

All Cursor rules should follow these conventions:

1. Rules should be stored in the `.cursor/rules` directory
2. Each rule should be in a separate file with a `.mdc` extension
3. Files should be prefixed with a number for ordering (e.g., `01-`, `02-`)
4. Rules should be written in Model-Driven Code (MDC) format
5. Each rule should have a name and description in the frontmatter
6. Rules should include a glob pattern using `globs:` in the frontmatter to ensure they are automatically included
7. Cursor rules should NEVER be placed outside the `.cursor/rules` directory
8. Filenames should use kebab-case (words separated by hyphens) after the number prefix
9. All headings should use sentence casing (first word capitalized) rather than title casing (all major words capitalized)

## Rule structure

A proper MDC rule should have the following structure:

```
---
description: Brief description of what the rule does
globs: **/*.{extension}
---

# Rule name

Brief overview of the rule's purpose and what it accomplishes.

## Details

More detailed explanation of how the rule works, what it enforces, and why it's important.

### Specific guidelines

Any specific guidelines, constraints, or behaviors the rule enforces.

## Example usage

This file itself serves as an example of a properly formatted Cursor rule.
```

## Correct vs. Incorrect Examples

### ✅ CORRECT Frontmatter:
```
---
description: Guidelines for building and testing Java code with Bazel
globs: **/*.java
---
```

### ❌ INCORRECT Frontmatter:
```
---
description: Guidelines for building and testing Java code with Bazel
glob: "**/*.java"  # Wrong: using singular "glob" instead of "globs"
---
```

```
---
description: Guidelines for building and testing Java code with Bazel
# Wrong: missing globs entirely
---
```

## File Naming Examples:

### ✅ CORRECT:
- `01-rule-conventions.mdc`
- `02-bazel-java.mdc`

### ❌ INCORRECT:
- `rule-conventions.mdc` # Missing number prefix
- `01_rule_conventions.mdc` # Using underscores instead of hyphens
- `01-rule-conventions.md` # Wrong file extension
- `rules/01-rule-conventions.mdc` # Wrong directory

## Heading formatting examples:

### ✅ CORRECT:
- `# Cursor rule conventions` (Sentence casing)
- `## File naming examples` (Sentence casing)

### ❌ INCORRECT:
- `# Cursor Rule Conventions` (Title casing)
- `## File Naming Examples` (Title casing)
