# Format Changes After Task Completion

When a task or feature has been completed, all code changes should be properly formatted before submission. This ensures consistent code style across the repository.

## Formatting Steps

Follow these steps to format your changes:

1. First, tidy up Bazel module dependencies:
   ```bash
   bazel mod tidy
   ```

2. Then format all code files using the project's formatter:
   ```bash
   bazel run format
   ```

## Importance

Proper formatting:
- Makes code reviews easier
- Ensures consistent style across the codebase
- Prevents unnecessary merge conflicts due to formatting issues
- Follows project conventions automatically

## When to Run

These commands should be run:
- After completing a feature or bug fix
- Before creating a pull request
- After addressing review comments that involved code changes
- Any time significant code modifications have been made

Always verify that the formatted code still builds and passes tests.
